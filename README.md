# QBot - PDF Query Answering Chatbot


**QBot** is an intelligent chatbot that answers user queries by extracting relevant information from uploaded PDF documents. The application uses **LangChain**, **Hugging Face**, and **vector databases** to deliver accurate and context-aware responses.

---

## **Features**

- **PDF Upload & Processing**: Users can upload a PDF file, and the document is parsed into smaller chunks for efficient querying.
- **Semantic Search**: The document content is embedded using **Hugging Face's** pre-trained models and stored in a vector database (**Chroma**).
- **Retrieval-Based Question Answering**: Answers are generated by retrieving the most relevant sections of the document using a retrieval-based QA pipeline powered by **LangChain**.
- **Gradio Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface powered by **Gradio**, where users can upload PDFs and ask questions interactively.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **LangChain**: For document processing, embeddings, and building the question-answering pipeline.
- **Hugging Face**: Deployed the GPT model (**EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B, google/flan-t5-large, google/flan-t5-xl**) for natural language understanding and question answering.
- **Chroma**: Used as a vector store for semantic search.
- **Gradio**: For creating an easy-to-use interactive web interface.
